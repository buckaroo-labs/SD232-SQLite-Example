# SD232-SQLite-Example
SQLite demo application

This project depends on sample data found at https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/. Since licensing terms on this data are not clear, rather than including that data here I have included download steps in the Makefile.

Clone this repository to your webroot, cd to the repo folder, and run "make" on any system that supports it. Otherwise, manually run the steps in the makefile.
